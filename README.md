This is jquery plugin, who open dialogs, where you cant upload image files (or other files) to server and elect it to form. Why I create another image manager plugin ? 
Because I want alternative to [Image plugin](http://ckeditor.com/addon/image) for [CKEDITOR](http://ckeditor.com/) and I want start to github open source and correct my terrible english ;)
